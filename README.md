## Introduction

CodyAI Resume Builder is an AI-powered tool designed to simplify and enhance the resume creation process. By leveraging GitHub data and OpenAI's advanced language models, CodyAI helps users craft compelling resumes that pass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and effectively showcase both hard and soft skills.

## What Problem Are We Solving?

In the competitive U.S. job market, listing and describing projects on a resume is challenging.

First, we need to frame our experience to pass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and then showcase our soft skills—such as problem-solving, teamwork, communication, creativity, resilience, initiative, leadership, organization, and learning—using strong action verbs like “Delivered,” “Built,” “Achieved,” “Implemented,” and “Collaborated.”

This is combined with hard skills, statistics, and a timeline to fit the STAR method: **Situation, Task, Action, and Result**. By doing so, we highlight our contributions, achievements, and impact, helping us to stand out.

This process requires extensive training—especially for me, as an English language learner—and can be time-consuming, especially when organizations seek a detailed and accurate story of your skills, interests, and the value you bring to a role.

## What is the Solution?

CodyAI leverages AI to streamline and enhance resume creation. It increases the accuracy of information by calling GitHub to gather all contributions and then sends the data to OpenAI, along with a carefully crafted prompt, to generate content.

When I joined the team, I was given an incredible opportunity by our project manager, [Tom Rau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-rau/), to collaborate with my team and continue advancing this AI-powered resume builder.

## Why Is This a Great Achievement for Us?

We’re not only solving real-world problems but also meeting several key design principles:

- **Scalable:** Admins can add project repositories within the app.
- **Faster:** It requests data concurrently from multiple repositories.
- **Cost-Effective:** We use two JavaScript libraries for Machine Learning, NLP and Natural.js, to refine data in-house before sending it to OpenAI, reducing costs by a third.
- **Secure:** Admins can securely store repository access credentials in our database with comprehensive instructions and 256-bit advanced encryption using the Crypto library.

## Features

- **Automated Data Gathering:** Fetches contributions from GitHub repositories automatically.
- **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Utilizes OpenAI to craft professional and optimized resume content.
- **ATS Optimization:** Ensures resumes are tailored to pass Applicant Tracking Systems.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-navigate web application with intuitive design.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Implements advanced encryption for data security.
